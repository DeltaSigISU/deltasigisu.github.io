# deltasigisu.github.io
A GitHub pages website for Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity at Iowa State University.


The main goal of this project is to market ourselves to potential members and get names. We can do this by highlighting what we do as a chapter. Such an example could be previous pictures of our spring 2023 formal. We can also highlight our brotherhood, philanthropy, and intramural sports. This is to get the end result of getting people to put in their contact information so we can get them over to the house and sign with us. We can either put in a dictionary through python and create our own data structure for contact information or we can embed a google form in the website. Either way works. 



Reference Website
https://the-goonies.webflow.io/#plot
I want to recreate the smoothness of the animations for this website. CSS? 

Nav Bar: Our Home, Activities, Who We Are, Contact Us





Our Home is Equivalent to Plot in Reference 

We can input a picture of our new house and have the letters of Delta Sigma Phi over the house picture while having beta alpha under DSP. Have a quick sentence of our house and highlight the renovations we are doing. Doesn’t have to be in depth or say exactly where the renovations were done, just the fact that the house is being updated and we are receiving help from our alum. Anyone who doesn’t know that our home name is the pyramid I don’t want them. 






Activities is Equivalent to Goonies in Reference

I want four pictures of different activities we do and when we click on the picture I want the same pop up as the reference website. Some activities ideas: Formal, Service, Brotherhood, and socials that we don’t have…All images will be in the image tab in github except for formal for now. For the pop up of description we can use ChatGPT idgaf as long as it sounds good.

If anyone has a picture of Spring Formal let me know where I can find it and I will place it in the images tab.

Contact Us Will be after Membership Section 

This is where I will put my contact info along with Erik as there should be two people they can contact. They should also have a link to our instagram in the bottom right corner where my contact info will also be present. There will also be either a data structure dictionary or an embedded google form for a potential member to contact us. We should also have our house location on this final section.
